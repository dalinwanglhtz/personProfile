                        I just want to say thank you (and your team) for your hard work. From guiding me 
                        step by step, to organising all the relevant documents, to finalising and follow-up 
                        with the bank and, of course, attending to my barrage of newbie questions at 10:30pm 
                        on a late Thursday night lol. You made this whole home loan application process easy 
                        for a first-timer such as myself. I really appreciate your professionalism, knowledge 
                        and the dedication. You showed that you actually cared about your client, and that is 
                        a very rare quality in this day and age.

                        Thank you! A great outcome; luckily covid didn't impact much on this project. 
                        We were a bit skeptical about the deliverability of the contractor in the beginning 
                        as their price was quite competitive. But, now gaining more confidence with the Infinity Plus. 
                        Now, Yanjin will start to collect funds for the next project! Much appreciate your very efficient 
                        and excellent service. I have attached a few photos as you may wish to see how your nearly 2 years 
                        of pursuit have resulted in something tangible.
