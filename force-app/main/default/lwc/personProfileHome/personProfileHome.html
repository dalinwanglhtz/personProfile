                        Maggie is a seasoned mortgage broker based in South East Victoria. Since 2011, she has underwritten many 
                        loans for customers of different background with various complexity.

                        customer cases with great passion, care and devotion. By constantly putting herself in other shoes, Maggie 
                        ensures every outcome is in customer's best interest not only at the time of the application but survive the

                        By mid-2021 Maggie was granted authorization to financial lending from at least 37 institutions. Including the big 
                        4 banks and a large range of reputable 
                        financial creditors. She's also a Platinum broker with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. This means every
                        loan application she submitted to CBA has very high chance of been attended by a credit assessor in the 
                        same day. It's a huge advantage for customer with requirements for urgent settlements.

                        than average brokers how the processs work end-to-end when it comes to purchasing a new property. This placed her
